<h2><a name="installation">Installation and startup</a></h2>

<h3><a name="install">Installation</a></h3>

<p>
Amis can be compiled and installed by the following procedure.
(In the following examples, % represents a shell prompt.)
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Run the "configure" script<br>
      <pre>% ./configure</pre>
      By default, the program is installed in /usr/local/.
      If you want to install Amis in another directory
      (let $DIR be the name of the directory),
      specify the option as follows.
      <pre>% ./configure --prefix=$DIR</pre>
      "configure" accepts various options other than "--prefix".
      <table border>
      <tr><th>Option<th>Default<th>Valid values<th>Effect</tr>
      <tr><td>--enable-debug<td>no<td>0 - 5 or no <td>Specify whether
      debug messages are printed or not.  The greater value is given,
      and more messages are printed.</tr>
      <tr><td>--enable-profile<td>no<td>0 - 5 or no <td>Specify
      whether profiling (measuring the execution time of each
      function) is enabled or not.  The greater value is specified,
      and more functions are profiled.</tr>
      </table>
      For other options, see the help message of the configure script
      printed by --help option.
      (Note that the options other than those listed above
      may not work correctly.)
  <li>Compile the program by the "make" command
  <pre>% make</pre>
  The executable "amis" is created in "./src/".
  <li>Install the executable and manuals.
  <pre>% make install</pre>
</ol>

<p>
Now you have "/usr/local/bin/amis" installed.
</p>


<h3><a name="running">Startup</a></h3>

<p>
To start up Amis, execute "amis" with an argument specifying a
configuration file (<a href="#input_output">described later</a>).
<pre>% amis [configuration file]</pre>
You can omit the argument, if you have a configuration file
named "amis.conf".
When the specified configuration file is not accessible,
the program stops with an error.
Amis also accepts several startup options.
</p>

<p>
Each line of a configuration file consists of
the name of a property and the specification of its value.
An example configuration file is shown below.
<pre>
DATA_FORMAT     Amis
FEATURE_TYPE    integer
MODEL_FILE      example.model
EVENT_FILE      example.event
OUTPUT_FILE     example.output
LOG_FILE        example.log
ESTIMATION_ALGORITHM    BFGS
NUM_ITERATIONS  1000
REPORT_INTERVAL 1
PRECISION       6
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Startup options of amis is specified as follows.
<pre>
% amis -e foo.event -a BFGSMAP [configuration file]
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Priority of the configuration is as below.
<ol>
  <li>Startup options
  <li>Configuration file
  <li>Default values
</ol>
</p>

<p>
You can specify the following items in a configuration file or as start-up options.
Other items will be shown by "-h" or "--help" option.

<h2><a name="input_output">Input/output</a></h2>

<p>
You need at least two kinds of files other than the configuration file:
<a href="#amis_model_file">the model file</a> and the <a href="#amis_event_file">event file</a>.
Their formats are described below.
</p>

<p>
For each file, # to the end of line is a comment and ignored.
Comments are treated as a space.  Each token is separated by spaces or
tabs, and "new line" represents the end of line.  Colons (:) are a
special character.  When you want to use these special characters as a
part of tokens, escape the character with a backslash (\).  A
backslash itself is represented as \\.
</p>


<h3><a name="amis_model_file">Input model files</a></h3>

<p>
A model file gives the names of feature functions and corresponding
initial parameters.  See the following example.
</p>

<pre>
[feature name]    [initial value]
[feature name]    [initial value]
[feature name]    [initial value]
...
</pre>

<p>
Each line corresponds to one feature.  First, you specify the name of
a feature.  For feature names, you can use any characters except for
spaces, tabs, colons (:), and pounds (#).  Next, following spaces or
tabs, specify the initial parameter of the feature.
Initial values are given by C-style floating point values.  Initial parameters can be any positive number
(if FEATURE_WEIGHT_TYPE is lambda, it can be any real number)
Usually, all the initial values are set to 1.0
(or 0.0, if FEATURE_WEIGHT_TYPE is lambda.)
</p>

<h4><a name="amis_event_file">Input event files</a></h4>

<p>
An event file gives a list of events used for training the model.
An event in maximum entropy models consists of
an observed event and its complement events.
Complement events are a list of alternative events
that could have been observed instead of an observed event.
Each event is regarded as a process of selecting
an observed event from a set of events consisting
of observed and complement events.
In Amis event files, both the observed and complement events
are represented by enumerating the activated features
of each event.
</p>

<p>
You have three choices of format of event files:
Amis, AmisFix, and AmisTree formats.
AmisFix format is used when the task
is to select a label from a fixed number of labels.
AmisTree format is used when events can be represented as feature forests.
</p>

<p>
Though Amis format and AmisTree format have, theoretically,
equivalent expressive power,
AmisTree format can be considerably efficient
both in terms of time and space, when
the problem allows compact description as feature forests.
AmisFix format has restricted expressive power,
but in case of simple classification problems,
it can work with smaller space requirements.
(Though it is possible that Amis format works better
in terms of estimation time.)
</p>

<h4><a name="event_amis">Amis format</a></h4>

<p>
<pre>
event_1
1    [feature] [feature] [feature] ...
0    [feature] [feature] [feature] ...
0    [feature] [feature] [feature] ...
0    [feature] [feature] [feature] ...
...

event_2
0    [feature] [feature] [feature] ...
1    [feature] [feature] [feature] ...
0    [feature] [feature] [feature] ...
...

...
</pre>

As [feature], you can write
<pre>
[feature name]
</pre>
or
<pre>
[feature name]:[feature value]
</pre>
if FEATURE_TYPE is integer or real.
</p>

<p>
Each block separated by blank lines corresponds to one event.
In the first line, you specify the name of an event.
You can use any characters except for special characters mentioned above.
(Event names can be arbitrary strings,
because they don't affect the results of estimation.)
Succeeding lines
represent an observed event or complement events.
At the beginning of a line, specify the number of times the event observed.
For an observed event, it should be positive integer, and for a complement event it should be zero.
Only one observed event is permitted for each event.
After the number of observation,
enumerate the names of activated features for an event.
Each feature must be defined in a model file.
If you specified a feature not found in a model file,
it would be an error.
The value of a feature function can be specified following the feature name.
As in the above example, the feature value is specified following a colon (:).
When omitted, it will be 1.
</p>

<p>
Each event description is separated by blank lines.
Note that a line with only comments is also treated as a blank line.
</p>


<h4><a name="event_amisfix">AmisFix format</a></h4>

<p>
First, you must prepare a file specified as FIXMAP_FILE,
which is used to map properties specified in event files
to feature names.
FIXMAP_FILE looks as follows.
<pre>
[label name] [label name] [label name] ...
[property name] [label name] [feature name]  [label name] [feature name] ...
[property name] [label name] [feature name]  [label name] [feature name] ...
[property name] [label name] [feature name]  [label name] [feature name] ...
...
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The format of an event file is as follows.
<pre>
[label name] 1 [property] [property] [property] ...
[label name] 1 [property] [property] [property] ...
[label name] 1 [property] [property] [property] ...
...
</pre>

As [property], you can write
<pre>
[property name]
</pre>
or
<pre>
[property name]:[property value]
</pre>
if FEATURE_TYPE is integer or real.
</p>


<p>
The first line of FIXMAP file enumerates the set of labels
used for classification.
Each of the other lines is a definition of a property,
and specifies the name of the feature that will
become active when the property and the label co-occur.
</p>

<p>
Each line of an event file corresponds to an observed event.
The line starts with the name of an observed label
and the frequency of observation.
The rest of the line enumerates the observed properties.
Amis generates an observed event automatically,
by mapping the pairs of the observed label and enumerated properties
to the features specified in FIXMAP_FILE.
The complement events are generated the same way,
using the labels other than the observed label.
</p>


<h3><a name="event_amistree">AmisTree format</a></h3>


<p>
<pre>
[event name]
[frequency]       [feature] [feature] [feature] ...
[disjunctive node]
</pre>
BNF-like representation of [disjunctive node] is as follows:
<pre>
[disjunctive node] :=
  [reference to some node name] |
  { [node name] [conjunctive node] [conjunctive node] ... }
[disjunctive node] :=
  [reference to some node name] |
  ( [node name] [feature] [feature] ... [disjunctive node] [disjunctive node] ... )
</pre>
You must put spaces before and after curly braces and round brackets,
so that they are not treated as a part of node
names or feature names.
</p>

<p>
A real example looks like this:
<pre>
event_1
2       feature1:2 feature2:3 feature3
{ dnode_1 ( node_1 feature1:2 { dnode_2 ( node_2 feature2:3 ) ( node_3 ) } { dnode_3 $node_2 ( node_4 feature3 ) } ) }

event_2
1       feature2:3
{ dnode_1 ( node_1 feature1 ) ( node_2 { dnode_2 ( node_3 feature2:3 ) ( node_4 feature3 ) } ) }

...
</pre>
</p>

<p>
As in the Amis format, a blank line separates each event description.
In the AmisTree format, an event is represented with three lines.  The
first line specifies the name of an event.  In the second line, you
show the number of times of the observed event and enumerate activated
features of an observed event.  In the above example, event_1 is
observed twice, and event_2 once.  As in the Amis format, specify the
name of a feature together with its value.  The third line represents
an observed event and complement events in a feature forest.
Disjunctive nodes are represented with curly braces.  Between the
curly braces, the name of a node is first specified, and conjunctive
nodes follow.
Node names must be unique in each event,
but you can use '_' for the nodes which are never refered to.
Conjunctive nodes are represented with round brackets.
Between the round brackets, the name of a node is first specified, and
activated features follow.  Feature descriptions are the same as Amis
format.  You can also specify disjunctive nodes as daughter nodes.
Node names are used to represent structure-sharing.  Already appeared
nodes can be refered by "$" followed by the node name.  In event_1 in
the above example, $node2 represents the sharing with node2 already
appeared.  By using node sharing and pack the feature forest smaller,
the computational complexity reduces, and the computation will be
accelerated.  You can use any characters except for special characters
for node names and feature names.
</p>


<p>
From a feature forest,
we can extract a set of feature lists
by the following mutual-recursive procedures.
<ul>
  <li>When the node is [disjunctive node],
      return the feature list which is obtained from one
      of its daughters.
  <li>When the node is [conjunctive node],
      return the union of the feature list of the node
      and the feature lists obtained from all of its daughters.
</ul>
An event written in AmisTree format can be converted
into an Amis format event which have
all the feature lists that can be extracted from
the feature forest as its observed and complement events.
The result of parameter estimation for AmisTree format events
is equivalent to that for such an Amis format events,
but the computational cost of the estimation is proportional to
the size of the feature forests.
</p>


<h3><a name="amis_output">Output</a></h3>

<p>
Amis outputs pairs of feature and parameter.  The output format is the
same as <a href="#model_file">a model file</a>.  Since the output
format is the same as a model file, the output file can be reused as
an input of the new computation.  That is, we can further progress the
parameter estimation given already estimated data.
</p>

<p>
Parameters <span class=math>a_i</span> corresponding to feature
functions are output, and we can compute the probability of an unknown
event by the product of <span class=math>a_i</span> for all activated
features.
</p>

<h2><a name="internal">Internal specs</a></h2>

Coming soon...


<hr>

<h2><a name="others">Misc. (restrictions and known bugs)</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The tractable size of events and features depends on the size of
  system resources (memory and hard disk).
  <li>When the memory is insufficient, try EVENT_ON_FILE option.
  <li>If you see "Infinite!" messages in GIS or IIS algorithms, or
  BFGS does not converge (you will see "Line search in BFGS algorithm
  ..."), parameter estimation seems to cause overflow or underflow.
  In such cases, specify "--parameter-type lambda" as a startup option.
  <li>In feature forest models, a feature vector specified in a line
  of an observed event must be included in a feature forest.  "amis"
  does not check this condition.  If this is not satisfied, parameter
  estimation may not converge.  This condition can be checked by
  the tool "forestcheck".
</ul>
